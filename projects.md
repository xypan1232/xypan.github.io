## [iDeep]
[iDeep] is a deep learning based framework to fuse heterogeneous data for predicting RNA-protein interaction sites. The deep learning framework can not only learn the hidden feature patterns from individual source of data, but also extracted the shared representation across them. In addition, the convolutional neural network in iDeep can automatically identify binding motifs. It is available at <a href="https://github.com/xypan1232/iDeep">https://github.com/xypan1232/iDeep</a>.
